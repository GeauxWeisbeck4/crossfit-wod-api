# Crossfit Workouts of the Day API

![Crossfit Bros](./public/images/crossfitbro.jpeg)

Welcome to my official repository for the *Crossfit Workouts of the Day API* (name is going to change once I decide what features and direction I'm taking this project). Currently, in the first version of the API, you can add workouts, records, and members. 

There are more functions and possibly a few more features that I'd like to add to the project after going through [the tutorial on FreeCodeCamp that I followed to build the base implementation that makes up the core of the WOD API](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/rest-api-design-best-practices-build-a-rest-api/) that was written by [Jean-Marc MÃ¶ckel](https://freecodecamp.org/news/author/jeanmarcmoeckel/). I highly recommend following this tutorial if you want a great walkthrough that teaches you the best practices of creating a REST API with Node.js, Express, and a few other friends. It leaves you with a great place to take off with the project and develop it into a viable product, so thank you Jean-Marc!

## Getting Started

1. Download the project files from GitHub or Git clone the project repository by using your terminal:
2. CD into the project file and run npm install
3. Fire up the API by running npm run dev and visit http://localhost:3000/api/v1/docs to learn more about the API with the Swagger documentation
4. Fire up your favorite code editor and add your own touch or help out with project issues!

## To Do

There is a project page for this on GitHub where you can view a beautiful Kanban board view of things that need to be done, features that need to be added, and ideas that need to be explored and evaluated.

Here is a brief rundown of a few things that are of the utmost importance right now:

- [ ] Finish Swagger Documetation
- [ ] Plan out the project with diagrams
- [ ] Conduct UX research for what features may be most desired
- [ ] Implement features and release first Version

I don't know if it's inappropriate to ask for money like this, but I'm currently panhandling to be able to eat and stay warm at night. I would love to stop panhandling ASAP and devote my time to money making projects since it seems like nobody will hire you when you're homeless, especially in coding.

Seeing that I am an exceptional programmer and love learning more about coding all the time, I think it would make more economic sense to be able to spend time working on projects that could help myself and others if I could put my mind and time into it. 

Please consider helping to make a donation so I can spend my day working on projects like this and not panhandling, a task that could get me hit by a car or possibly leave me hungry when nobody wants to help. All donations allow me to put more time into coding, learning, and getting off the streets.

If you would like to hire me or get some type of financial return for your contribution, email me at andrewweisbeck4@gmail.com or text me at 919-771-7752 and we can discuss employment opportunities or financial return possibilities. 

Thank you for your help in advance - you really don't understand how much it means to me and helps out me and my fiance.
